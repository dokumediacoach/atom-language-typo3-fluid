# TYPO3 Fluid Language package

Adds syntax highlighting to TYPO3 Fluid tags and inline notations in Atom.

## Language detection

Language auto detection does not always work properly (HTML was a bad choice for
the Fluid file extension IMO).  
If auto detection fails, use the Grammar Selector by clicking on "HTML" in the
Atom status bar at the bottom on the right or by pressing
<kbd class="platform-all">Ctrl+Shift+L</kbd> and pick "TYPO3 Fluid".
